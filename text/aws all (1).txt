          the Github and save it for future       …. project files in the Github and copy

…. commands in it to install nodejs:-
         pwd (to check if it is in server)
.
         sudo apt-get update
         sudo apt-get upgrade
         sudo apt install nginx
         nginx –v (to check nginx version)
         curl –s1 https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x |sudo -E bash -
         sudo apt install nodejs
         node –v (to check nodejs version)

         node –v




    6.    To upload the project on EC2 server type the following commands:-
          git clone https address of the github hub repository where project is uploaded
          (For username type your github username and for password enter the personal access token)
          dir (to check the directory of the project)
          cd hello1/ (to enter into repository)
          npm install (node package manager installation to run node commands)
          node index.js (as project is uploaded start server)
7.   On pasting the public Pv4 address address of EC2 server ,the project wont load because only
     through specific ports it is accessible.Go to git hub and check for the ports permitted for the
     project by opening the index.js file.
     Now to address this issue go to instance(in aws) -> security -> security groups -> edit
     inbound rules -> Add rules -> set type as custom tcp , port range as specified in index.js file,
     source as anywhere-IPv4 and 0.0.0.0/0 ->save rules.Now type the port number after colon in
     IPv4 address and the website will be accessible.
     Hence the project is successfully deployed from github to EC2.




8.   If there is some editing done in the project it will not be reflected in the website.For
     that we need to terminate the server using ctrl+c and then type the follow command:-
             git pull
             (enter the github username and its token as password)
             node index.js
     Now,refresh the browser to see the changes reflected on it.

       However, to access the webpage one always
       requires the public IPv4 address of the server
       instance which is very complicated/less
       accessible for end-users of our webpage/web
       application. To make it easier for our end-users,
       we need to bind a domain name to the server
       instance so that anyone can use the domain
       name and the URL to access the project.
       Now Search “Route 53” in the search bar of

     find all the details of your purchased Domains.
s
     This may vary from site to site, so you will have to do this based on what site you are using.
